# ContractDR

This repository hold ContractDR, a tool that takes as input a hypothesised contract and an executable program, and uses a Counter Example Guided Inductive Repair algorithm to validate and/or repair the contract. Our evaluation of repairing over 2,000 mutants generated from 29 contracts for 4 non-trivial Java benchmarks, results in successful repair rate of 67.2% to 95.3% with median execution time that ranges from 26.1 seconds to 99.3 seconds.
